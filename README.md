# 💌 **Pookie Proposal Project** 💌

Welcome to the ultimate project for winning hearts, making your pookie swoon, and ensuring your proposal game is top-notch! 🎉 Whether you're gearing up for a magical "yes" or simply want to show off your coding chops, this project is for you.

## 📜 **Project Overview**

This project is a delightful HTML application designed to ask out your pookie in the most charming way possible. Complete with interactive elements and a touch of humor, it's the perfect way to make your pookie feel special. The project uses EmailJS to handle form submissions, so you can get those love notes straight to your inbox!

## 💌 **EmailJS Integration**

To make sure your messages don't get lost in cyberspace, we've used EmailJS to handle sending emails. Here’s what you need to know:

1. **EmailJS Public Key**: Replace `"YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY"` in `yes.html` with your actual EmailJS public key. You can find this in your EmailJS dashboard.
2. **Service ID**: Replace `"contact_service"` with your actual EmailJS service ID.
3. **Template ID**: Replace `"contact_form"` with your actual EmailJS template ID.
4. **Recipient Email**: Make sure the form is set to send emails to the correct address—by default, it’s set to `youremailaddress@pookie.in`.

## 🚀 **Getting Started**

1. **Fork the Repository**: Click that glorious “Fork” button to make your own copy of this project.
2. **Update EmailJS Settings**: Make sure to replace the placeholders in the `yes.html` file with your actual EmailJS credentials.
3. **Deploy Your Site**: Use [Render](https://render.com) to deploy your static site. Simply follow the steps below.

### Render Deployment

1. **Connect Your Repository**: Link your GitHub repository containing this project to Render.
2. **Configure Settings**:
   - **Root Directory**: Leave this empty if your `index.html` is in the root of the repository. Otherwise, specify the subdirectory (e.g., `src`).
   - **Build Command**: Leave this empty for static sites.
   - **Publish Directory**: Enter `./` if your `index.html` is in the root. Adjust if your files are in a different directory.
3. **Deploy**: Click the deploy button and wait for Render to build and publish your site.

## 🎨 **Customization**

## 💌 **Example Usage**

**Pookie Proposal Page**: This is where you ask your pookie out! Customize the text to match your own romantic flair.
